# Godot-SaveSystem (Godot 4.1)
System for saving/reading data and migrating data. This is especially useful for adding new things which need to be safed, without overwriting the file (and with that killing all saved items).

ToDo (feel free to make Pull requests):
- Adding reversed migrating (Now, if you change the default layout, only keys are added, but not removed so the player may save useless data; This should be no issue implementing without corrupting stuff)
- Adding encrypted data saving
